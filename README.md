## Overview

This project leverages several technologies for Continuous Integration (CI) and Deployment (CD), including Jenkins, Ansible, Minikube, and Kubernetes. Here's a brief overview of each component:

1. **Jenkins:**
    - Jenkins is used for CI/CD automation.
    - Installation: Follow [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-jenkins-on-ubuntu-20-04) to install Jenkins on a GCP Compute Engine instance.
    - Ensure Java is installed: `sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk`.
    - Additional Resources:
        - [Jenkins Installation on GCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<video_id>).

2. **Ansible:**
    - Ansible is used for configuration management and deployment automation.
    - Installation: Refer to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRMPKQweySE).
    - Instance Type: Verify a micro instance is used for Ansible.
    - Key Generation: Execute `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword` for the Ansible key.

3. **Webapp (Kubernetes):**
    - Kubernetes is used for container orchestration.
    - Instance Type: Verify a medium instance is used for the Webapp.
    - Docker Installation: Use the commands in the Dockerfile.
    - Minikube Installation: Refer to the commands in the Minikube file.
    - Minikube Explanation: Minikube facilitates local execution of Kubernetes.

## Work Steps

### 1. Link Jenkins with GitHub

- Establish a webhook for real-time communication between GitHub and Jenkins.
- Webhook Explanation: A mechanism for GitHub to notify Jenkins about repository events.
- CI Setup: Create a Dockerfile, commit it to GitHub, and configure Jenkins to trigger builds.

### 2. Send Docker File to Ansible

- Jenkins acts as a server, Ansible as a client.
- SSH Setup: Establish passwordless SSH between Jenkins and Ansible.
- Tutorial: [Configure SSH Passwordless Login](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<video_id>).

### 3. Build Docker Image and Tag

- Utilize Jenkins pipeline to connect to Ansible.
- Build Docker Image: Run `docker image build â€“t $JOB_NAME:v1.$BUILD_ID`.

### 4. Push Docker Images to Docker Hub

- Push the built Docker image to Docker Hub for versioning and tracking.

### 5. Deployment

- Establish SSH connection between Ansible and the Webapp server.
- Update Ansible's host file for best practices.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Mirrorlist Error:**
  - If Dockerfile fails, update it with the solution provided [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70963985/error-failed-to-download-metadata-for-repo-appstream-cannot-prepare-internal).
